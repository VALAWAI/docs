# VALAWAI documentation

Documentation over the software developed on the VALAWAI project.


## Development

This documentation is using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
You must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 
If you have  __Node__  you can use directly the next command.
On the other hand if you have  __Docker__  you can start a container with all the necessary
sofware with the script `./startDevelopmentEnvironment.sh`.

 * `npm start` Starts the development server and you can browse the documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
 * `npm run build` Bundles your website into static files for production.
 * `npm run serve` Serves the built website locally.
 * `npm run deploy` Publishes the website to GitHub pages.
