This results in influencing the behaviour of the C0 component. Control,\nhowever, is not only over other system components. Control may also happen over the topology itself. For example,\na C2 component may decide that a C1 component should switch from relying on one C0 component that detects hate\nspeech to another C0 component that incorporates users' feedback to adapt what is considered hate speech.\nThis may be implemented by disconnecting C1 from the first C0 component and connecting it to the second.\nControl may also happen over the real-world.
