# Patient Treatment Planner Demonstration

A key use case for the VALAWAI architecture, as described in [Medical Protocols](/docs/use_cases/medical_protocols/),
involves incorporating value considerations into medical protocols. This 
demonstration simplifies this use case, showcasing how a doctor can define 
patients, specify their current health status, and design a set of actions 
(a treatment plan) to achieve a desired outcome. After defining the treatment, 
the doctor receives feedback, including:

*   Whether the treatment adheres to the NIT protocol.
*   How well the treatment aligns with various values associated with the chosen 
actions.

This demonstration utilizes the [Master Of VALAWAI (MOV)](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov) 
as the implementation of the [VALAWAI Architecture](/docs/architecture/value_awareness_architecture), 
along with the following components:

*   [C0 Patient Treatment UI](/docs/components/C0/patient_treatment_ui): Provides 
the user interface for doctors to manage patients, define treatments, and visualize 
feedback.
*   [C1 NIT Protocol Manager](/docs/components/C1/nit_protocol_manager): Checks 
if the actions of a treatment follow the NIT protocol.
*   [C2 Treatment Autonomy Evaluator](/docs/components/C2/treatment_autonomy_valuator): 
Calculates the autonomy value alignment of a treatment.
*   [C2 Treatment Beneficence Evaluator](/docs/components/C2/treatment_beneficence_valuator): 
Calculates the beneficence value alignment of a treatment.
*   [C2 Treatment Justice Evaluator](/docs/components/C2/treatment_justice_valuator): 
Calculates the justice value alignment of a treatment.
*   [C2 Treatment Nonmaleficence Evaluator](/docs/components/C2/treatment_nonmaleficence_valuator): 
Calculates the nonmaleficence value alignment of a treatment.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this demonstration, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. 
Installation instructions and platform-specific guides are available on the official 
Docker website: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).

## Build the Docker Containers

Instructions for building Docker containers for each VALAWAI software component 
are detailed in their respective documentation.  To streamline this process, 
a `buildContainers.sh` script is provided below.  This script automates the container 
build process, downloading the latest code and building the Docker images as needed. 

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import treatement_build_containers_sh from '!!raw-loader!./treatment_build_containers.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="buildContainers.sh" showLineNumbers>{treatement_build_containers_sh}</CodeBlock>

How to use the script:

1. **Save the script**: Copy the code above and save it as `buildContainers.sh` 
in your VALAWAI project directory.

2. **Make it executable**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where 
you saved the script.  Then, make the script executable by running the following 
command:

```bash
chmod +x buildContainers.sh
```

3. **Run the script**: Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
./buildContainers.sh
```

After that, the script will download the latest code of each component and build 
its Docker image if necessary.


## Create Docker Compose file

To deploy the demo components, a `docker-compose.yml` file will be used. This file 
defines the services that Docker Compose will start to orchestrate the demonstration.  
Create a file named docker-compose.yml in your project directory and copy the following 
code into it.

import treatment_docker_compose_yaml from '!!raw-loader!./treatment_docker_compose.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="docker-compose.yml" showLineNumbers>{treatment_docker_compose_yaml}</CodeBlock>

On the code above, the `docker-compose.yml`, defines the following services:

* **Line 2:** Defines the Master of VALAWAI (MOV) service. See the 
[MOV Deployment documentation](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/deploy) 
for more details.
* **Lines 34 and 55:** Define the services required by MOV: RabbitMQ and MongoDB, 
respectively.
* **Line 82:** Configures the C0 Patient Treatment UI. See the 
[C0 Patient Treatment UI Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C0/patient_treatment_ui#deploy) 
for more information.
* **Line 110:** Configures the PostgreSQL database required by the C0 Patient Treatment UI.
* **Line 132:** Configures the C1 NIT Protocol Manager. See the 
[C1 NIT Protocol Manager Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C1/nit_protocol_manager#deploy) 
for details.
* **Lines 155, 179, 203, and 227:** Configure the C2 Treatment Value Evaluators:
    * Autonomy Evaluator ([Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C2/treatment_autonomy_valuator#deploy))
    * Beneficence Evaluator ([Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C2/treatment_beneficence_valuator#deploy))
    * Justice Evaluator ([Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C2/treatment_justice_valuator#deploy))
    * Nonmaleficence Evaluator ([Deployment documentation](/docs/components/C2/treatment_nonmaleficence_valuator#deploy))


## Running the Demonstration

The following steps demonstrate the [VALAWAI Architecture](/docs/architecture/value_awareness_architecture) 
and the [Master Of VALAWAI (MOV)](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov).

 1.  **Start MOV:** Launch the MOV with: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=mov docker compose up -d`.  
 Access the MOV user interface at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Initially, 
 no components or connections will be visible.

 2.  **Start the Doctor UI:** Launch the doctor's user interface with: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=C0 docker compose up -d`. 
 Refresh the MOV UI ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) to see the newly 
 registered C0 component. No topology connections will be present yet.

 3.  **Using the Doctor UI:** Open the doctor's user interface in your browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) 
 and perform the following steps:
 
   3.1 **Add a Patient:** Go to "Patients" and add a new patient, providing 
   the name and status.
   
   3.2 **Add a Treatment:** Click the three dots next to the patient's name, 
   select "Add treatment to patient," review the current status, click "Next," 
   select the actions to apply, define the expected status after the treatment, 
   and then add the treatment.  Note that the treatment will not have any feedback 
   information at this point because the C1 and C2 components are not yet running.
   
 4.  **Start the NIT Protocol Manager (C1):** Launch the C1 component with: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=C1 docker compose up -d`. 
 Refresh the MOV UI ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) to see the registered 
 C1 component and the connection between C1 and C0 in the topology.

 5.  **Check NIT Protocol Adherence:** Once the C1 component is ready, return to the doctor's 
 user interface ([http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)), go to the previously created 
 treatment, and click the reload icon. After a few seconds, you will see whether the treatment 
 actions follow the NIT protocol.

 6.  **Start the Value Evaluators (C2):** Launch the C2 components with: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=C2 docker compose up -d`. 
 Refresh the MOV UI ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) to see the four registered 
 C2 components and their connections to the C0 component.

 7.  **Check Value Alignment:** Once the C2 components are ready, return to the doctor's UI 
 ([http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)), go to the created treatment, and 
 click the reload icon. After a few seconds, you will see the value alignment feedback 
 for the treatment.

**Convenience Commands:**

*   **Start All Components:** `COMPOSE_PROFILES=all docker compose up -d`
*   **Stop All Components:** `COMPOSE_PROFILES=all docker compose down` (Note: this command will stop 
all services regardless of the profile used to start them).  If you only want to stop 
the `mov` profile you can use `COMPOSE_PROFILES=mov docker compose down`
