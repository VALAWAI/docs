# Demonstrations

To showcase the capabilities of the [VALAWAI Architecture](/docs/architecture/value_awareness_architecture), 
we've developed the following value-aware application examples:

*   **E-Mail Assistant:** This demonstrator illustrates a value-aware email application
 that intelligently assists with composing and replying to emails.  
 [View Demonstration](/demonstrations/email)
*   **Patient Treatment Planner:** This demonstrator allows doctors to define 
treatment plans for patients and receive feedback on the potential value and effectiveness 
of those plans. [View Demonstration](/demonstrations/treatment)
