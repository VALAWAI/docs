 / [Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en):** 
 As the project coordinator, CSIC provides overall leadership and management for VALAWAI.  
 Beyond coordination, CSIC is also deeply involved in the development and execution of 
 the [Medical protocols](/docs/use_cases/medical_protocols/) use case and the development
 of the [RGNW Toolbox](/docs/architecture).

* **[Fundació Institut Hospital del Mar d'Investigacions Mèdiques (IMIM)](https://www.imim.es/en_index.html):**
IMIM plays a crucial role in the [Medical protocols](/docs/use_cases/medical_protocols/) use case, 
contributing to the definition of an integrative model for moral cognition in AI and the development of behavioral
and neuroscience studies.

* **[Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)](https://www.iit.it/en-US/):** 
IIT contributes significantly to the [Social robots](/docs/use_cases/social_robots/) use case,
 developing experiments for behavioral testing of human-robot interaction.

in the [Social robots](/docs/use_cases/social_robots/) use case.

* **[Sony Europe BV](https://csl.sony.fr/):** Sony Europe BV leads the development of 
the [Social media](/docs/use_cases/social_media/) use case, defining quantitative measures 
for Value-Aware AI, detecting markers of moral values in social media, and creating a plug-in 
for social media monitoring.

* **[Studio Stelluti](https://stelluti.art/):** Studio Stelluti is responsible for disseminating
 the VALAWAI project's findings and exploring potential exploitations of its results.

The VALAWAI project receives crucial funding from the European Union under the European Innovation
Council (EIC) research and innovation programme, grant agreement number 101070930. This support
has been fundamental to the project's initiation, development, and continued progress, enabling
us to pursue ambitious research goals and contribute to advancements in the field.
