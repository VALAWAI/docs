# Architecture

One of the main objectives of the VALAWAI project is to build upon the cognitive
model of the Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW) to develop a computational
cognitive architecture for modeling value awareness in AI.  This architecture
provides a foundation for creating value-aware applications and promoting responsible
AI development.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the VALAWAI architecture, 
covering the following key areas:

*   **[Neural Model](/docs/architecture/neural_model):** This section details 
the underlying neural models that inspire the VALAWAI architecture. It describes
the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model and the Reflective Global Neuronal Workspace
(RGNW) model, explaining how these models inform the project's approach to value
awareness.  It also discusses the key principles and mechanisms of these models
relevant to the VALAWAI implementation.

*   **[Value Awareness in VALAWAI](/docs/architecture/value_awareness):** 
This section clearly defines what value awareness means within the specific context
of the VALAWAI project. It explores the project's interpretation of values, how they
are represented, and how they influence decision-making within the AI system.  
It also clarifies the scope and limitations of the project's approach to value awareness.

*   **[VALAWAI Architecture](/docs/architecture/value_awareness_architecture):** 
This section provides a detailed description of the VALAWAI architecture itself.  
It outlines the different components of the architecture, their interactions, and
how they contribute to value-aware behavior.  Diagrams and visual representations 
are included to illustrate the architecture's structure and data flow.  This section
also explains how the architecture incorporates the principles of the chosen neural
models (GNW/RGNW).

*   **[Implementations](/docs/architecture/implementations):** 
This section showcases the different implementations of the VALAWAI architecture.  
It provides concrete examples of how the architecture has been applied in various contexts,
demonstrating its capabilities and flexibility.  Code snippets, usage examples, 
and links to relevant repositories are included where appropriate.  This section
also highlights best practices for implementing and extending the architecture.
