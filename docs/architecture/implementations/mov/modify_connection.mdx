# Modify topology connection

As outlined in the value awareness architecture, the data and control flow of messages are
exchanged by the VALAWAi components, as described by a topology that will be managed by 
the Master Of VALAWAI (MOV). In the previous section, we described the services to create connections
(see section [create connection](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/create_connection))
and search for connections (see section [Connection query](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/connection_query)).
The remaining service is the capability of the `C2` components to enable, disable, 
or remove these connections. For this purpose, the `C2` component must be
sent to the queue **valawai/topology/change** a message with the following payload:

 - **action**: Specify the modification to be performed on the connection. The possible
    actions are: **ENABLE**, **DISABLE**, or **REMOVE**.
 - **connection_id**: The identifier of the topology connection to change.

The MOV enables a topology connection by subscribing to the source channel and publishing 
the received messages on the target channel. Conversely, when disabling the connection, 
it unsubscribes from the source channel. Finally, if the topology connection is also enabled
before marking it as deleted in the database, the MOV will continue to publish messages
on the target channel.

The following JSON demonstrates an example of the message payload to modify a topology connection:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import modify_connection_json from '!!raw-loader!./modify-connection.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{modify_connection_json}</CodeBlock>
