# Web user interface

To begin using the Master of VALAWAI (MOV), initial deployment is required, as detailed 
in Section [deploy](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/deploy). This section provides
a comprehensive guide to the setup and configuration process, ensuring a smooth initial
setup. Once deployed,
the user-friendly web interface becomes accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
This interface offers a streamlined experience for managing the MOV's core features.

## Manage components

If you click on the upper left a menu appears and you select **Components**, or you click
over **Components** on the footer left menu, you will see all the registered components
on the Master of VALAWAI (MOv) as you can see in the next image.

The web interface offers the next key functionalities for managing components within
the VALAWAI architecture:

 - **Component Registration**: Components can self-register by sending
    a registration message (see Section [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component)).
    Users can also manually register components via the web interface. This
    is accomplished by clicking the ___Register a new component___ button and completing
    the displayed form with the component's type, name, version, and AsyncAPI
    specification. Upon submission, the component is registered within the MOV.

 - **Component Discovery**: The MOV provides a robust mechanism for
    querying information about registered components (see Section
    [components query](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/component_query)). 
    This functionality is accessible to both components and users. The user interface
    allows for searching based on the following criteria:

     - ___Name___: search for components by their name (supporting
        partial and exact matches).
     - ___Description___: Search for components based on keywords
        within their descriptions.
     - ___Type___: Filter components by their type (C0, C1, or C2).


    Search results can be ordered alphabetically or numerically by any of these
    criteria (name, description, or type) to facilitate browsing and analysis.
    When viewing the details of a specific component, in addition to 
    the aforementioned fields, the interface displays the messages that the component
    publishes and subscribes to. Furthermore, users can request information about
    the connections in which the component is involved, specifying whether
    it is the source or target of the connection.

 - **Component Unregistration**: Typically, a component's last action
    within the VALAWAI architecture is to unregister itself from the MOV (see Section
    [unregister component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/unregister_component)). 
    Users can also manually unregister components through the web interface. 
    This is done by searching for the component and
    clicking the ___Unregister___ action. A confirmation page then appears.
    Upon confirmation, the MOV removes the component and any connections in which
    it participates.


## Manage topology

If you click on the upper left a menu appears and you select **Topology**, or you click
over **Topology** on the footer left menu, you will see all the registered topology
connections on the Master of VALAWAI (MOv) as you can see in the next image. 

![Screen shot of the topology connections view](/img/tutorials/mov/topology_connections.png)

The web interface offers the next key functionalities for managing the VALAWAI topology:

 - **Connection Creation**: While the MOV automatically establishes
    connections between components upon registration, as detailed in Section 
    [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component), 
    the system also supports manual connection creation by both components and users 
    (see Section [create connection](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/create_connection)).
    To create a connection via the user interface, select the ___Create a new 
    connection___ button. This action will display a form prompting for the following
    information:

     - ___Source Component and Channel___: Select the component that will
        initiate the communication and the specific channel it will use.

     - ___Target Component and Channel___: Select the component that will 
        receive the communication and the corresponding channel it will use.

     - ___Connection Status (Enabled/Disabled)___: Specify whether 
        the connection should be active (enabled) or inactive (disabled) upon creation.
        
    Once the form is submitted with valid information, the connection is established 
    within the MOV.

 - **Connection Discovery**: The MOV allows both components and users
    to query for existing connections within the VALAWAI architecture (see Section 
    [connections query](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/connection_query)). 
    Users can leverage the interface's search functionality by entering partial or 
    exact matches for either the source or target component's name. The search results 
    are then presented, sorted by the following criteria:

     - ___Source Component___: Alphabetical order of the source
        component's name.
     - ___Target Component___: Alphabetical order of the target
        component's name.
     - ___Connection Status___: Ordered by whether the connection is
        enabled or disabled.

    This sorting facilitates efficient browsing and identification of specific 
    connections.

 - **Connection Modification**: As explained in the [VALAWAI architecture](/docs/architecture/value_awareness_architecture) 
    documentation, C2 components are responsible for managing connections
    between other components (see Section [modify connection](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/modify_connection)). The web
    interface provides users with the ability to modify these connections as well. 
    Through the interface, users can perform the following actions on existing 
    connections registered within the MOV:

     - ___Enable___: Activate a disabled connection, allowing communication
        to flow between the connected components.
     - ___Disable___: Deactivate an active connection, preventing
        communication.
     - ___Remove___: Permanently delete a connection from the MOV, 
        severing the communication path between the components.

    These modification capabilities provide granular control over
    the VALAWAI topology.


## Manage logs

If you click on the upper left a menu appear and you select **Logs**, or you click
over **Logs** on the footer left menu, you will see all the notified logs on
the Master of VALAWAI (MOv) as you can see in the next image.

![Screen shot of the logs view](/img/tutorials/mov/logs.png)

These log messages transmitted to the MOV (see Section [add log message](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/add_log)). For each log entry, the following information is displayed:

 - ___Timestamp___: The precise time at which the log message was generated.
 - ___Log Level___: The severity level of the message, categorized as
    `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`.
 - ___Message___: A human-readable description of the event or condition
    being logged.
 - ___Component___: The name of the component that generated the log message.

If a log message includes an associated payload in JSON format, the user interface 
presents this payload in a human-readable format, facilitating detailed inspection.

In addition to log visualization, the user interface provides a robust search and 
filtering mechanism for log messages. This functionality allows users to refine
the displayed logs based on the following criteria:

 - ___Message Content___: Filtering is performed using partial or
    exact string matching on the message text.
 - ___Component Name___: Filtering is performed using partial or exact
    string matching on the component name.
 - ___Log Level___:  Filtering is performed by selecting one or more
    log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR).
 - ___Component Type___: Filtering is performed by selecting one or more 
    component types (C0, C1, or C2).

The filtered results can be ordered by the following attributes:

 - ___Timestamp___: Chronological order of log generation.
 - ___Log Level___: Order of severity (e.g., `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`).
 - ___Message Content___: Alphabetical order of the message text.
 - ___Component Type___: Order of component types (C0, C1, or C2).
 - ___Component Name___: Alphabetical order of the component name.


## RESTful API

The Master Of VALAWAI (MOV) exposes a RESTful API, mirroring the functionality 
available through the user interface. This API allows programmatic interaction 
with the MOV, enabling external systems and applications to manage and monitor 
the VALAWAI system.  Full documentation for these services can be found in 
the [openapi.yaml](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VALAWAI/MOV/main/openapi.yaml)
file. The user interface itself is built upon these same API endpoints.

The following services are currently provided:

 - **GET /v1/components**: Retrieves a paginated list of registered components, 
 including relevant information about each component.
 - **GET /v1/components/\{component_id\}**: Retrieves detailed information about 
 a specific registered component, identified by its `component_id`.
 - **POST /v1/components**: Registers a new component with the system. 
 - **DELETE /v1/components/\{component_id\}**: Unregisters a component from the system, 
 identified by its `component_id`.
 - **GET /v1/connections**: Retrieves a paginated list of registered topology 
 connections, including information about each connection.
 - **GET /v1/connections/\{connection_id\}**: Retrieves detailed information about 
 a specific topology connection, identified by its `connection_id`.
 - **POST /v1/connections**: Registers a new topology connection with the system. 
 - **PUT /v1/connections/\{connection_id\}**: Modifies the status of a specific topology
 connection, identified by its `connection_id`. This might be used to enable, 
 disable or remove a connection, for example.
 - **GET /v1/logs**: Retrieves a paginated list of log messages from the system. 
 This endpoint likely supports filtering and sorting by log level, timestamp, etc.
 
This RESTful API provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the MOV. 
The [OpenAPI specification](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VALAWAI/MOV/main/openapi.yaml) 
provides detailed information about the request and response formats for each 
endpoint, facilitating client development.
