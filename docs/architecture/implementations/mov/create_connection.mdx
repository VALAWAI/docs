# Create topology connection

Upon component registration (as described in section [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component)),
the Master of VALAWAI automatically establishes connections between the new component and 
any other registered components. Although this service is rarely utilized, it is provided 
to address any potential scenarios. For instance, if a connection is removed and subsequently 
reestablished, this service ensures compatibility. Furthermore, when utilizing this service,
it is imperative that the messages published by the source component of the connection align 
with the messages anticipated by the target component.

To create a topology connection, send a message to the queue **valawai/topology/create**
with the following payload:


 - **source**: The source node information is essential for establishing a topology
    connection. It includes the following details:

     - **component_id**: The identifier of the component that initiates the connection.
     - **channel_name**: The name of the component's channel that publishes messages
        entering the connection.

 - **target**: The information of the node that serves as the connection's target.
    It also includes the following details:

     - **component_id**: The identifier of the component that receives messages
        from the connection.
     - **channel_name**: The name of the component's channel that subscribes 
        to messages passing through the connection.

 - **enabled**: A boolean value indicating whether the connection must be enabled.

The following JSON demonstrates the message payload used to establish a topology connection.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import create_connection_json from '!!raw-loader!./create-connection.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{create_connection_json}</CodeBlock>


Upon the registration of the topology connection, the MOV will determine whether any registered 
`C2` entities must be notified of the messages exchanged on the connection, as outlined in
Section [Notify C2 components](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/notify_c2_components).
Consequently, the MOV will identify all `C2` components that have subscribed to a channel
with the name **valawai/c2/\textbackslash w+/control/\w+**. Additionally, it will verify
that the schema of the notification message aligns with the messages exchanged in the topology
connection. Specifically, the field **message_payload** must correspond to the messages
exchanged during the topology connection.
