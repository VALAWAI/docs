# Deployment

The Master of VALAWAI (MOV) is designed for deployment using Docker containers. 
Docker is a popular platform for software containerization, allowing applications 
to run in a self-contained environment with all their dependencies. This simplifies 
deployment and ensures consistency across different computing environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying MOV, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Installation
instructions and platform-specific guides are available on the official Docker 
website: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).


## Deployment Steps

1. **Open a terminal:** After installing Docker, open a terminal session. The following
deployment procedures will be executed via the command-line interface.

2. Execute the following commands in your terminal:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import deploy_mov_sh from '!!raw-loader!./deploy_mov.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers>{deploy_mov_sh}</CodeBlock>
 
  * In the line 4 this command retrieves the most recent stable release of the Master of VALAWAI.
  * In the line 7 it is the command to go to the dowloaded directory.
  * In the line 10 it is the command to execute the deployment script. This script handles the building
  the MOV Docker image, and starting the necessary dependencies.

3. **Access MOV**: Upon successful completion, the MOV user interface can be
accessed via a web browser at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) 
(see the [web user interface](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/user_interface)
documentation for further details).

## Services deployed

The deployment script automatically starts the following services:

 - **RabbitMQ**: The message broker used for inter-component communication within MOV.
 - **MongoDB**: The persistent data store used by MOV for managing information about
  components, connections, and logs.

## Stopping MOV

To stop the MOV deployment and its associated services (RabbitMQ and MongoDB), execute
the following script:

```bash
./stopMOV.sh
```

This script should be located in the same directory as the `runMOV.sh` script. 

## Building the Docker Image

The recommended way to create a Docker image for the Master Of VALAWAI (MOV)
is to run the script:
 
 ```bash
 ./buildDockerImages.sh
 ```

This script will build the image and tag it with the component's version 
(e.g., `valawai/mov:1.4.0`).

The script offers several options for customization:

* **Specify tag:** Use `-t <tag>` or `--tag <tag>` to assign a custom tag name 
to the image (e.g., `./buildDockerImages.sh -t my-custom-image-name`).
* **Help message:** Use `-h` or `--help` to display a detailed explanation 
of all available options.

For example, to build an image with the tag `latest`, run:

```bash
./buildDockerImages.sh -t latest
```

This will create the container named `valawai/mov:latest`.


## Environment Variables

Environment variables allow you to configure the MOV application's runtime
behavior within the Docker container without rebuilding the image. This section
describes the available environment variables:

### RabbitMQ Configuration

*   `RABBITMQ_HOST` (Default: `mov-mq`): The hostname or IP address where the RabbitMQ
 service is listening.
*   `RABBITMQ_PORT` (Default: `5672`): The port on which the RabbitMQ service is listening.
*   `RABBITMQ_USERNAME` (Default: `mov`): The username for RabbitMQ authentication.
*   `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` (Default: `password`): **CRITICAL:** Change this default password
 immediately for security reasons.

### MongoDB Configuration

*   `QUARKUS_MONGODB_HOSTS` (Default: `mongo:27017`): The hostname(s) or connection string
 for the MongoDB server.
*   `QUARKUS_MONGODB_DATABASE` (Default: `movDB`): The name of the MongoDB database used
 by the application.
*   `QUARKUS_MONGODB_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME` (Default: `mov`): The username for MongoDB authentication.
*   `QUARKUS_MONGODB_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD` (Default: `password`): **CRITICAL:** Change this default
 password immediately for security reasons.

### Other Configuration

*   `MOV_URL` (Default: `http://localhost:8080`): The URL where the MOV user interface will be accessible.

### Security Best Practices:

*   If an environment variable is not set, the application will use its default value.
*   For production deployments, **never** store passwords directly in environment variables,
Dockerfiles, or scripts. Use Docker secrets, a dedicated secrets management service 
(e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or other secure configuration mechanisms to manage sensitive information.

 
## Use with docker compose

When you deploy the Master Of VALAWAI (MOV) inside a Docker Compose environment, 
you can use the provided health check REST endpoints to determine when MOV is ready. 
These endpoints are:

 - **/q/health/live**: Checks if the component is running.
 - **/q/health/ready**: Checks if the component can process messages from the VALAWAI infrastructure.
 - **/q/health/started**: Checks if the component has started.
 - **/q/health**: Retrieves all the previous check procedures in the component.
 
All of them will return a JSON object with the status (either UP or DOWN) and 
the list of checks that have been evaluated.  The /q/health endpoint provides 
a comprehensive overview.  You can also view the health status using the health
user interface at [/q/health-ui/](http://localhost:8080/q/health-ui/).

These endpoints are useful for Docker Compose health checks, as shown in the following example:

import mov_docker_compose_yaml from '!!raw-loader!./mov_docker-compose.yaml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>{mov_docker_compose_yaml}</CodeBlock>

This Docker Compose file defines the MOV service with dependencies on RabbitMQ and MongoDB. 
The healthcheck section uses `curl` to check the `/q/health` endpoint.  Adjust the `interval`, 
`timeout`, `retries`, and `start_period` as needed for your environment.  This example also 
demonstrates how to specify dependencies between services using `depends_on`.
