# Unregister a component

When a component desires to be hidden from other VALAWAI components, 
it must transmit a message to the VALAWAI master to unregister itself. 
For this purpose, the component must send a message to the queue 
**valawai/component/unregister** with a payload comparable to the following:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import unregister_component_json from '!!raw-loader!./unregister-component.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{unregister_component_json}</CodeBlock>

In this payload, it is necessary to specify the identifier of the VALAWAI
component (line 2) that has been received when the component has been registered
, as explained in the section [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component).
