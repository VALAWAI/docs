# Query about registered components

The Master of VALAWAI (MOV) maintains the topology of the VALAWAI infrastructure. Consequently,
it possesses information about all registered components. Therefore, if a component is aware
of certain details about the other active components in VALAWAI, it can send a message to 
the channel **valawai/component/query** with a query and subsequently receive a response
from the MOV on the channel **valawai/component/page**.

The payload of the query will be structured as follows:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import component_query_json from '!!raw-loader!./component-query.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{component_query_json}</CodeBlock>


The first field of this payload (line 2) is an optional field that defines the identifier query.
Following that, you specify the pattern to match the name or description (line 3) and the type 
(line 4) of the components to return. In both cases, if the value is defined between forward
slashes (/), it is considered a PCRE regular expression. If it is not defined or **null**,
this field is not used in the query.
The next field (line 5) defines the order of the components to return. It is formed by the
field names, separated by a comma, and each of them with the **"-"** prefix for descending
order or **"+"** for ascending. The possible fields are **"type"**, **"description"**,
**"name"** or **"since"**. By default, it is **"+since"**. Finally, you define
the index of the first component to return (line 6) and the maximum number of components
to return (line 7).

The MOV will respond to the query to the channel **valawai/component/page** with a payload
containing the following fields:


 - **query_id**: An optional field that defines the identifier of the query for which
    this is the answer.
 - **total**: The number of components that satisfy the query.
 - **components**: An array of components that satisfy the query. If any component
    matches the query, this field will be **null**. Each component will have the following
    fields:

     - **id**: The identifier of the component.
     - **name**: The name of the component.
     - **description**: The description of the component.
     - **version**: The version of the component.
     - **api_version**: The version of the asyncapi that describes the services
        of the component.
     - **type**: The type of the component, which can be `C0`, `C1`, or `C2`.
     - **since**: The epoch time, in seconds, since the component became available.
     - **channels**: An array of channels that the component provides. If the component
        does not provide any services, this field will be **null**. Each channel will have 
        the following fields:

         - **id**: The identifier of the channel that matches the queue name.
         - **description**: The description of the channel.
         - **subscribe**: The type of payload that the channel can receive. If this
            is **null**, the channel does not receive any messages. The possible types are
            string, integer, boolean, object, array, constant, reference to another object, 
            or a type combination that must select one of, any of, or all of.
         - **publish**: The type of payload that the channel can send. If this is 
            **null**, the channel does not send any messages. The possible types are string,
            integer, boolean, object, array, constant, reference to another object, or a type
            combination that must select one of, any of, or all of.

The next JSON is an example of the payload of a message that responds to a query.

import components_page_json from '!!raw-loader!./components-page.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{components_page_json}</CodeBlock>
