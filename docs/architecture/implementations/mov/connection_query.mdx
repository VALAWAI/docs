# Query about topology connections

The Master of VALAWAI (MOV) maintains the topology of the VALAWAI infrastructure. Consequently, it 
possesses information about all the connections between the components. Therefore, if a component
is aware of certain details about the topology in VALAWAI, it can send a message to the channel 
**valawai/topology/query** with a query and subsequently receive a response from the MOV
on the channel **valawai/topology/page**.

The payload of the query will be structured as follows:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import connection_query_json from '!!raw-loader!./connection-query.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{connection_query_json}</CodeBlock>

The initial field of this payload (line 2) is an optional field that defines the identifier query.
Subsequently, you specify the source channel name (line 3) or identifier (line 4) and the same
for the target channel name (line 5) or identifier (line 6). In all these fields, if the value
is defined between forward slashes (/), it is interpreted as a PCRE regular expression. If the 
value is not defined or is **null**, this field is not utilized in the query.
The subsequent field (line 7) defines the order of the components to be returned. It is constructed
by concatenating the field names, separated by a comma, with the **"-"** prefix for descending
order or the **"+"** prefix for ascending order. The valid field names are 
**"createTimestamp"**, **"updateTimestamp"**, **"enabled"**, 
**"source.componentId"**, **"source.channelName"**, **"target.componentId"** or
**"target.channelName"**. By default, it is set to **"-updateTimestamp"**. Finally, 
you specify the index of the first component to be returned (line 8) and the maximum number
of components to be returned (line 9).

The MOV will respond to the query to the channel **valawai/topology/page** with a payload
containing the following fields:


 - **query_id**: An optional field that defines the identifier of the query for which
    this is the answer.
 - **total**: The number of connections that satisfy the query.
 - **connections**: An array of connections that satisfy the query. If any connections
    matches the query, this field will be **null**. Each component will have the following
    fields:

     - **id**: The identifier of the connection.
     - **create_timestamp**: The epoch time, in seconds, when the connection has
        been created.
     - **update_timestamp**: The epoch time, in seconds, when the connection has
        been updated.
     - **source**: The node that is the source of the connection. It will have 
        the following fields:

         - **component_id**: The identifier of the component that the topology
            connection starts.
         - **channle_name**: The name of the component's channel that will
            publish the messages that enter into the connection.
        
     - **target**: The node that is the target of the connection. It will have 
        the following fields:
        
         - **component_id**: The identifier of the component that the topology
            connection ends.
         - **channle_name**: The name of the component's channel that will subscribe
            to the messages that pass through the connection.

The next JSON is an example of the payload of a message that responds to a query.

import connections_page_json from '!!raw-loader!./connections-page.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{connections_page_json}</CodeBlock>
