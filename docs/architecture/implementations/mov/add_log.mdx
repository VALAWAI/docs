# Add logging message

The Master Of VALAWAI (MOV) utilizes RabbitMQ for communication with the components of the VALWAI value 
awareness application. This enables the utilization of RabbitMQ's distributed architecture, allowing 
components to be deployed on different hosts. This capability empowers different components to operate
on separate machines while maintaining continuous and seamless communication.
To facilitate development, the MOV facilitates the sending of log messages by components to it, 
which can be visualized in a user interface (as demonstrated in section [MOV user interface](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/user_interface).
These messages must be sent to the channel **valawai/log/add** with a payload similar to 
the following:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import add_log_json from '!!raw-loader!./add-log.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{add_log_json}</CodeBlock>

This payload defines the logging level at line 2. It can be **ERROR**, **WARN**,
**INFO**, or **DEBUG**. After that, you can define the message of the log (line 3).
Optionally, you can define an optional payload value (line 3). This payload must be a JSON 
value encoded as a string. Finally, if you want, you can define the identifier of the component (line 5)
that has generated the log message. This identifier is the one obtained when the component
is registered, as you can see in the section [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component).
