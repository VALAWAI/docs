# Register Component

When a component within the VALAWAI system needs to be accessible or visible to other
VALAWAI components, it must communicate this by sending a message to the designated channel, 
**valawai/component/register**. This message is crucial for ensuring that other components
can recognize and interact with it. The payload of this message should adhere to a specific
structure, exemplified as follows:


import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import register_component_json from '!!raw-loader!./register-component.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{register_component_json}</CodeBlock>

This payload consists of several key components:


 - **type**: This specifies the category of the component. In this example (as seen in line 2),
  the type is marked as "C0." The component type can also be designated as "C1" or "C2,"
  depending on its functionality and role within the system.

 - **name**: This refers to the specific identifier of the component
    (illustrated in line 3). The name should be unique and descriptive, allowing other
    components to easily recognize and reference it.

 - **version**: This indicates the current version of the component
    (noted in line 4). Proper versioning is essential for maintaining compatibility
    and managing upgrades or changes to the component over time.

 - **asyncapi_yaml**: This element (found in line 5) includes a detailed
    specification of the services that the component offers, encoded as a string in YAML format.
    This specification follows the AsyncAPI specification (explained in section
    [Interaction Specification](/docs/architecture/implementations/component#interaction-specification)),
    which provides a standardized way to describe the asynchronous communication
    between components, including relevant channels and the structure of messages.
    

Upon receiving this specific message, the Master of VALAWAI (MOV) initiates a comprehensive 
validation process to verify the payload content. Upon successful validation, the information 
is securely stored within the database. Furthermore, the MOV automatically assesses
any potential connections between newly registered components and existing components
within the system, thereby facilitating the automatic updating of the VALAWAI component topology.

If the specifications for a new component include a designated communication channel 
for notification during the registration process, the MOV sends an acknowledgment message 
upon successful registration within the system (for further details, please refer to
Section [registered component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/registered_notification)).

For components classified as type C2, the MOV provides additional functionality. If a C2
component incorporates a notification channel for messages exchanged over topology connections,
the MOV proactively searches for any existing registered connections that align with 
the anticipated message notification requirements. For more information on this process, 
please refer to Section [Notify C2 components](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/notify_c2_components).
This ensures that C2 components remain informed and can effectively communicate as integral 
components of the overall system.
