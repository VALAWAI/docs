# Inform the registered component of this action

As previously mentioned in Section [Register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component), 
a component can be notified when it has been registered if the specification contains
a channel that commences with **valawai**, followed by the component's type, name, 
and terminates with **/control/registered**. This pattern matches the regular 
expression **valawai/c[0|1|2]/\w+/control/registered**. The subscription message
payload will be comparable to the subsequent JSON example.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import registered_component_json from '!!raw-loader!./registered-component.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{registered_component_json}</CodeBlock>


On this payload, line 2 presents the unique identifier that distinguishes the component in VALAWAI, 
accompanied by the epoch time, in seconds, at which the component is registered (line 9).
The name (line 3), version (line 5), and type (line 7) of the component provided in the registration 
message (refer to section [Register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component)
for further details) are also included. Furthermore, the extracted information from 
the component's asynchronous API specification version is contained on line 6, and 
the channels on line 9. For each channel, the name (line 11) and description (line 12) 
are provided. If the channel is a subscription (line 13) or a publish (line 34), a description 
of the anticipated payload of messages sent or received from the channel is also included.

With regard to all this information, the component identifier (line 2) holds paramount importance,
as the component will require it to execute various actions, such as unregistering itself,
as demonstrated in section [unregister component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/unregister_component).
