# Notify about a sent message through a topology connection

There exists a distinct channel exclusively designed for the C2 components. This service
serves to notify these components of the messages exchanged during any topology connection. 
The channel name must adhere to the specified pattern: 
**valawai/c2/\textbackslash w+/control/\w+**.
For instance, if a service named **"sent_text"** is implemented on a C2 component named
**"text analyzer"**, then the channel name should be 
**"valawai/c2/text_analyzer/control/sent_text"**. This channel must define a payload
that conforms to the following example:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import notify_c2_connection_message_json from '!!raw-loader!./notify-c2-connection-message.json';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{notify_c2_connection_message_json}</CodeBlock>


As illustrated in the preceding example, the anticipated fields for this payload are:

 - **connection_id**: The identifier of the topology connection that facilitates message
  exchange (Line 2).
 - **source**: The source component responsible for initiating the message transmission
    (Line 3). It will contain the identifier, name, and type of the source component.
 - **target**: The target component designated to receive the message
    (Line 8). It will also contain the identifier, name, and type of the source component.
 - **message_payload**: The payload data transmitted through the connection (Line 13).
 - **timestamp**: The epoch time, expressed in seconds, indicating the moment
    of message transmission (Line 16).


As outlined in Section [register component](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/register_component),
the Master Of VALAWAI (MOV) will detect channels of this type when a component is registered.
Subsequently, the MOV will notify the component of messages from the topology connection 
that match the payload specified in the specification.
