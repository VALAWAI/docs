# Component Specification

The VALAWAI toolbox consists of components that can be combined to create 
value-aware applications. These components adhere to specific conventions and 
file structures, as described below. The architectural teams involved in the 
VALAWAI project have established these guidelines to ensure consistency, clarity, 
and functionality in component development and integration.

## Name Format

Component names follow the format `C[0|1|2]_component_name`, where `[0|1|2]` 
represents the component type (C0, C1, or C2), and `component_name` is a 
descriptive name in lowercase Python case. For example, a C0 component named 
"voice to text" would be named `C0_voice_to_text`.

## Version Schema

All components follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), structured 
as `major.minor.bug`.  The version number reflects the component's development 
status. For example, the initial version is 1.0.0. After seven minor changes 
and two bug fixes, the version becomes 1.7.2.

Backward compatibility is guaranteed only for minor versions within the same 
major version.  While backward compatibility across major versions is encouraged, 
it's not mandatory.


## License

Components in the RGNW toolbox are primarily distributed under the 
[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license.  While this license 
is recommended, other licenses are permitted.  The specific license used must 
be clearly documented.

## Repository

The source code for all VALAWAI components is publicly available on GitHub under 
the [VALAWAI organization](https://github.com/VALAWAI). This promotes transparency 
and collaboration.

## Deployment

Components are deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. This ensures structured 
and efficient deployment, clearly defining the component and its integration with 
platforms like the [Master Of VALAWAI (MOV)](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov), 
as well as any necessary databases or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ).

## Required Files

Each component must include the following files:

*   **README.md:** A comprehensive overview of the component, including a brief 
description, key features and functionalities, build instructions, deployment 
procedures, and any dependencies.

*   **LICENSE:** The component's license information.

*   **CHANGELOG.md:** A record of significant changes across all public versions, 
detailing new features, bug fixes, enhancements, and any breaking changes, along 
with upgrade instructions.

*   **[asyncapi.yaml](#interaction-specification):** A description of the component's 
services in standard AsyncAPI format, detailing endpoints, message structures, 
and parameters.

*   **docker-compose.yml:**  A Docker Compose file for deploying the component, 
including necessary configurations, environment variables, and service dependencies.

## Interaction Specification

The component's services are described in the `asyncapi.yaml` file, using the 
[AsyncAPI specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/en) version 2.6.0.  The key 
sections are:

*   **info:** General component information (title, version, description, contact, license).
*   **channels:** Description of sent and received messages.
*   **components:** Message and schema definitions.

The `info` section defines `title` (e.g., "VALAWAI C0 Voice to text"), `version`, 
`description`, `contact` (partner name and URL), and `license`.

The `channels` section describes each service (one channel per service) using the 
template `valawai/c[0|1|2]/component_name/[control/data]/operation_name`.  This 
template uses lowercase letters, Python case, and satisfies the 
[RFC 6570 URI template](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570). For example, a C0 
"voice to text" component's service for processing audio might be named `
valawai/C0/voice_to_text/data/audio_to_process`.  Channels are defined as `publish` 
(sends messages), `subscribe` (receives messages), nor both.  A `summary` field
 provides a one-sentence description when both are used.  Each message is referenced.

The `components` section contains `messages` (with `contentType: application/json` 
and a schema reference) and `schemas` (describing message content). Message and 
schema names use lowercase Python case. Schema properties use lowercase Python 
case and include `type` and `description`, with optional `examples`.

Below is an example of an `asyncapi.yaml` description for a C0 component that extracts 
text from an audio file:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import C0_voice_to_text_asyncapi from '!!raw-loader!./c0_voice_to_text.yml';

<CodeBlock language="yaml">{C0_voice_to_text_asyncapi}</CodeBlock>

### Special Channels for MOV Integration

When using the [Master of VALAWAI (MOV)](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov), 
specific channel patterns enable integration:

1.  **Registration Channel (`valawai/c[0|1|2]/component_name/control/registered`):** 
If this channel is defined, the MOV [publishes a message](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov#notify-registered-component) 
to it upon component registration. This message contains component information 
(id, name, description, version, api\_version, type, since, channels).

2.  **C2 Notification Channel (`valawai/c2/\w+/control/\w+`):**  This channel is *exclusively* 
for C2 components. It notifies the C2 component about messages exchanged between other 
components via a topology connection. The channel name matches the pattern `valawai/c2/component_name/control/service_name`. 
The `subscribe` message payload schema includes:

    *   `connection_id`: ID of the topology connection.
    *   `source`: Information (id, name, type) of the source component.
    *   `target`: Information (id, name, type) of the target component.
    *   `message_payload`: The message payload that was exchanged.
    *   `timestamp`: Epoch time of the message send.

    The MOV uses this channel to [notify](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov#notify-about-a-sent-message-through-a-topology-connection) 
    C2 components about messages sent through active topology connections that match the `message_payload` 
    type.  Specifically, when a [connection is registered](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov#create-a-topology-connection), 
    the MOV checks for registered C2 components with a matching C2 Notification Channel and 
    `message_payload` type.  Conversely, when a C2 component with this channel type is registered, 
    the MOV checks for existing connections with a matching `message_payload` and adds the C2 
    component to those connections for notifications.
