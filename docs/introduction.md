# Introduction

Our values shape our behavior and understanding of ourselves and others. Just 
as values are fundamental to human interaction, imbuing AI systems with an understanding
of values is crucial for building trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence. 
What we consider self-evident in human interactions must be explicitly programmed into AI.

The VALAWAI project addresses this critical need by providing developers with a 
comprehensive toolbox. This toolbox empowers them to infuse AI applications with mechanisms
that promote value-awareness and ensure alignment with human values, ultimately leading
to more responsible and trustworthy AI.

This documentation provides information about the VALAWAI toolbox and its components. 
The documentation is organized into the following sections:

*   **[Architecture](/docs/architecture/):** Describes the VALAWAI architecture based on
 the GNW neuron model.
*   **[Use Cases](/docs/use_cases/):** Describes the use cases that have guided the VALAWAI
 project's scientific research and from which the components of the VALAWAI toolbox have been
 developed.
*   **[Components](/docs/components/):** Provides information about how components are defined
 and details the available components that make up the toolbox.
*   **[Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/):** Provides instructions on how to create a component 
or use the VALAWAI architecture.
*   **[Demonstrations](/docs/demonstrations/):** Provides scripts demonstrating how to use 
the VALAWAI toolbox to run value-aware applications.
*   **[Glossary](/docs/glossary/):** Defines terms and concepts used in the documentation.
