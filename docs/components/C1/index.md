# C1

C1 components analyze information received from C0 components 
and make decisions. Due to their context-specific nature, 
C1 components tend to be less reusable than C0 components.

The following C1 components are defined in the RGNW toolbox:

*   **LLM Dialogue Manager:** The [LLM dialogue manager](/docs/components/C1/llm_dialogue_manager) 
determines the most appropriate response to maintain a natural 
conversation flow.

*   **Moral-Topic Similarity:** The [Moral-topic similarity](/docs/components/C1/moral_topic_similarity) 
component evaluates the desirability of a Twitter post based 
on user preferences.

*   **LLM Email Replier:** The [LLM email replier](/docs/components/C1/llm_email_replier) 
generates replies to received emails.

*   **NIT Protocol Manager:** The [NIT protocol manager](/docs/components/C1/nit_protocol_manager) 
verifies whether a given treatment adheres to the NIT protocol.
