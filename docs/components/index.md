# Components

The components defined on the [RGNW toolbox](/docs/toolbox/) can be of the types:

 * [C0 components](/docs/components/C0/) are concerned with information extraction
 and task execution. They process the world forward this information to the C1 components,
 and receive action from C1 components to change the environment.
 * [C1 components](/docs/components/C1/) are responsible for integrating and analyzing
 the information coming from C0 components and making decisions accordingly.
 * [C2 components](/docs/components/C2/) is the reflective layer analyzing the value
 alignment of behavior. These components constitute the main novelty of VALAWAI,
 and it is here that the reasoning with values will manifest, requiring capabilities
 such as value acquisition, value representation and reasoning, value alignment mechanisms,
 and value-driven explainability.
