demonstration. This tool showcases functionalities that would be 
beneficial in a real-world patient care setting, including:

 - **Patient data management**: Efficient storage and access to patient
  information.

 individual patient needs.

access to patient information, facilitating personalized treatment 
plans, and providing clear and concise presentation of critical 
information related to patient care.
