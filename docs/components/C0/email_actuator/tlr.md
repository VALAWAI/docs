# Technology Readiness Level (TLR)

I infer the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the code in the VALAWAI/C0_email_actuator component, specifically on the develop branch, to be TRL 6: System/sub-system model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.

Here's the reasoning for this assessment:

Existence of a Functional Prototype (TRL 5-6): The provided documentation clearly indicates the presence of executable code that can be built into a Docker image (./buildDockerImages.sh). It has defined environment variables, health check endpoints, and specific functionalities (sending emails, connecting to RabbitMQ). This goes beyond a basic concept or experimental proof.

Demonstration in a Relevant Environment (TRL 6): The instructions detail how to set up a comprehensive "Development environment" using docker-compose. This environment includes the component itself, along with its key dependencies like the Master of VALAWAI (MOV), RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Mongo Express, and a Mail Catcher. This setup closely mirrors the intended operational environment, allowing for demonstration and testing of the component's functionality within a system context. The ability to run tests (mvn test, mvn -DuseDevMOV=true test) within this simulated environment further supports this level.

Structured Development and Testing (Implies TRL 4-6): The presence of dedicated scripts for starting/stopping the development environment, cleaning the project, and running tests (including one against a running MOV) indicates a structured development process. The detailed explanation of environment variables and log access methods suggests a focus on maintainability and debugging within this relevant environment.

Not Yet in Full Operational Environment (Prevents TRL 7-9): While it's demonstrated in a relevant environment, the documentation focuses on development and local deployment. There isn't explicit information about the component being deployed in a live, fully operational production environment, undergoing rigorous long-term performance validation, or being "flight-proven" (in a software context, meaning widely used and validated in real-world scenarios at scale).

Therefore, the component is a mature prototype that functions well within a controlled, representative environment, but lacks explicit evidence of full operational deployment and validation that would typically characterize TRL 7 or higher.


Selecting the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for software is an exercise in assessing its maturity, functionality, and validation within increasingly realistic environments. It's a continuous spectrum, and a system might have different TRLs for different sub-components.

Here's a guide with a checklist and patterns to help you infer and prove a software's TRL:

Software Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Guide
Use this checklist to assess the TRL of a software component or system. For each TRL, evaluate if your software meets the "Key Characteristics" and if you can provide the corresponding "Proof Patterns."

TRL 1: Basic Principles Observed
Definition: Research begins. Lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific principles identified.
Key Characteristics (Software):
Idea or concept exists, purely theoretical.
No actual code or experimental validation.
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Research papers, academic proposals, whitepapers, conceptual diagrams.
High-level architectural sketches (without implementation details).
TRL 2: Technology Concept Formulated
Definition: Practical application of basic principles identified; conceptual design.
Key Characteristics (Software):
Specific application of the technology is formulated.
Feasibility studies or initial analysis of potential solutions.
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Detailed architectural design documents, requirement specifications.
Feasibility reports, initial system diagrams (e.g., UML, flowcharts).
Algorithms described in pseudo-code or formal notation.
TRL 3: Analytical & Experimental Critical Function/Characteristic Proof-of-Concept
Definition: Active R&D initiated. Analytical studies and small-scale experiments validate individual elements.
Key Characteristics (Software):
Core algorithms or critical functions are coded and demonstrated in isolation.
Minimal viable product (MVP) or "proof-of-concept" code.
Not integrated into a larger system; often run in a simple lab/developer setup.
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Source code for core components or algorithms.
README files with simple execution instructions.
Basic unit tests demonstrating critical function.
Console output or screenshots showing a successful isolated run.
TRL 4: Component and/or Breadboard Validation in Lab Environment
Definition: Basic technological components integrated to establish compatibility and perform basic tests.
Key Characteristics (Software):
Multiple core modules or components are integrated and tested together.
Validates functionality within a controlled, "laboratory" (developer's machine, local VM) environment.
Dependencies (databases, message queues) might be run locally in simple setups (e.g., single Docker containers).
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Codebase with multiple integrated modules.
docker-compose.yml for local development setup (e.g., spinning up a DB).
Integration tests verifying inter-component communication.
Basic API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specs).
Manual testing procedures or simple automated test scripts.
TRL 5: Component and/or Breadboard Validation in Relevant Environment
Definition: Thorough testing of integrated basic components in a relevant environment (simulated operational conditions).
Key Characteristics (Software):
The integrated components are tested with more realistic data or under conditions that simulate the target operational environment.
Performance benchmarks might be conducted in a controlled, but more robust, staging-like environment.
Deployment might involve more complex local setups or dedicated staging environments for testing.
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Test data generation scripts that mimic production data.
Performance benchmark results in a simulated environment (e.g., with load generators).
Integration with mock services that behave like real external dependencies.
Detailed deployment instructions for a staging or pre-production environment.
Alpha release to a very small, controlled user group for initial feedback.
TRL 6: System/Sub-system Model or Prototype Demonstration in Relevant Environment
Definition: A representative model or prototype system, significantly greater than TRL 5, demonstrated in a relevant environment.
Key Characteristics (Software):
A fully functional prototype of the entire system or a major sub-system.
Automated build and deployment processes (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
Comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) against a relevant environment.
Robust logging, metrics, and health checks are implemented.
Demonstrable to stakeholders (e.g., internal demos, proof-of-concept for clients).
Proof Patterns (Evidence):
Passing CI/CD pipeline results.
Comprehensive test reports (e.g., code coverage, successful E2E test runs).

Customer testimonials, case studies, success metrics from actual users.
Compliance with industry standards and certifications.
Evidence of continuous improvement based on operational data and user feedback.
Important Considerations for TRL Assessment:

TRL is a Continuum: Don't think of TRLs as rigid, discrete boxes. Software often progresses smoothly from one TRL to the next, with overlaps.
Context Matters: What constitutes a "relevant environment" or "operational environment" depends heavily on the software's purpose. A TRL 6 for an internal utility might look different from a TRL 6 for a public-facing service.
Evidence is Key: Always back up your TRL claim with concrete, verifiable evidence (the "Proof Patterns").
Focus on the Lowest TRL: If any critical component or aspect of your system is at a lower TRL, the entire system's TRL cannot exceed that level.
