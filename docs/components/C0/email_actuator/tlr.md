# Technology Readiness Level (TLR)

From our viewpoint, the 'C0 e-mail actuator' component has currently reached 
**TRL 3: Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic 
proof-of-concept**. This assessment is based on the following:

 - **Demonstrated Core Capability**: We have successfully developed and demonstrated 
 the fundamental capability of the 'C0 e-mail actuator' to perform its critical function: 
 receiving a message, converting it into an email format, and successfully publishing 
 it through a test mail server.

 - **Unit-Level Validation**: We have developed and executed unit tests to validate 
 this specific functionality in a controlled laboratory environment, proving the basic 
 operational principles of the component.
 
The main challenge to advance the 'C0 e-mail actuator' to TRL 4 is its robust integration 
into a demonstrator of the VALAWAI Toolbox. Currently, it functions as a standalone 
proof-of-concept. Achieving TRL 4 requires defining and implementing stable interfaces (APIs) 
and clear communication protocols to ensure seamless message flow and reliable interaction 
with upstream VALAWAI services that will feed it messages. This shift is challenging because
it moves the component beyond isolated functionality, requiring it to become a reliable, 
integrated part of a larger system, which can expose complexities in data formats, message 
queues, and error propagation throughout the complete workflow.
 
A second significant challenge lies in ensuring compatibility and robustness with commercial 
email servers. Our current validation is limited to a test mail server. To achieve TRL 4, 
we need to test the 'C0 e-mail actuator' thoroughly with commonly used commercial email servers 
(e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo). This includes verifying successful email delivery, handling 
diverse security protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0 for modern APIs), rate limits, and different 
authentication mechanisms without problems. This is challenging because commercial email providers 
have varying standards, security measures, and usage policies that can significantly impact 
deliverability and functionality, requiring specific adaptations and rigorous testing beyond 
a generic SMTP setup. Addressing these challenges will transition the 'C0 e-mail actuator' 
from a validated concept to a functionally integrated and tested component within a laboratory 
environment, ready for its role as part of the broader VALAWAI Toolbox.
