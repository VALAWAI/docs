# Text interface

Text interfaces constitute the simplest form of human-computer interaction, allowing users to
use typed commands or textual inputs, which is a direct and efficient means of communication
with a system. Despite the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which offer more visually
intuitive interactions, text interfaces remain relevant due to their lightweight nature and
simplicity. Consequently, the reduced complexity allows to focus on other aspects of the system,
which is useful during the debugging phase of a project.
With this component it is possible to input dialogue in the VALAWAI system, and receive the
corresponding responses. The component can be customised with the identifier for the participant
in the dialogue. The input is performed with a simple text interface, and the output is
displayed in the same interface.
