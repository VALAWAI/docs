# Architecture

One of the main objectives of the VALAWAI project is to build upon the cognitive model of the
global neuronal workspace theory (GNW) to develop a simple computational cognitive architec-
ture for modelling value awareness in AI. 

One of the main objectives of the VALAWAI project is to build upon the cognitive model of
the global neuronal workspace theory (GNW) to develop a simple computational cognitive architecture
for modelling value awareness in AI. In this section, we first provide an introduction to the global
neuronal workspace and how we propose to implement it ([The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)](/toolbox/architecture/gnw)).
We then define what value awareness means to VALAWAI ([Value awareness](/toolbox/architecture/value_awareness)),
before we present our proposal for modifying the existing global neuronal workspace to account for value awareness
([The Reflective Global Neuronal Workspace model (RGNW)](/toolbox/architecture/rgnw)).
