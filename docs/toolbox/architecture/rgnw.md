# The Reflective Global Neuronal Workspace model (RGNW)

To extend the GNW model with value awareness, we propose to introduce a reflective layer.
The original Global Neuronal Workspace model addresses how the workspace that is based
on distributed cognitive processing could converge on a unified description of a situation, and
how decisions are made accordingly. But there is a second important facet of consciousness,
namely the ability to reflect and engage in meta-level reasoning. This dual nature of processing
is well documented for moral judgement, shown to involve both a direct intuitive judgement and
rational symbolic decision-making [[Haidt, 2013]](/references#7294). Dual processing has also been confirmed in
neuro-imaging studies [[Greene et al., 2001]](/references#greene2001fmri).

Processing at layer C0 (information extraction) and C1 (information integration) is often called
primary consciousness and related to Kahneman’s ‘fast intuitive decision making’ (system 1).
Processing at layer C2 is often called higher-order consciousness and is related to Kahneman’s
‘slow decision making’ (system 2). The VALAWAI project tackles the reflective facet of consciousness
by including a meta-layer (corresponding to layer C2 of next image), which is able to
monitor what is going on at C1 and engage in deliberation, of which the outcome may again be
injected in layer C1 through re-entrant processing. This is similar to the cognitive architecture
for robot consciousness proposed by [[Chella et al., 2008]](/references#chella2008cognitive). The focus of VALAWAI, however,
will be to have C2 components that reflect specifically on values. As such, the technical capabilities
presented in the previous sub-section will form the capabilities of C2 components, and
what could be achieved with value-awareness will manifest through C2’s interaction with C1
and C0.
