# How to define a VALAWAI component in Python with Pika

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to establishing a [VALAWAI component](/docs/architecture/implementations/component)
utilizing the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) in conjunction with the with
the [Pika libary](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The subsequent sections will systematically
detail the essential aspects of component development within the VALAWAI architecture.

The tutorial is structured as follows:

 * [Component skeleton](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/skeleton). This section elucidates
 the fundamental organizational structure, including the necessary directories and files, 
 for a VALAWAI component implemented with Python and Pika.
 * [Component services](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/services). Discover how to define 
 and implement the unique services your component will offer to the wider VALAWAI ecosystem.
 * [Interaction with the Master Of VALAWAI](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/mov_interaction).
 This section details the standard communication protocols and interactions between a component
 and the [Master Of VALAWAI](/docs/architecture/implementations/mov/)
 * [Dockerize the component](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/docker_image). Learn the best 
 practices for creating a Docker image, enabling easy deployment and sharing of your component.
 * [C1 echo example](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/example). A practical, step-by-step 
 demonstration of developing a "C1 echo" component that listens for and echoes messages.
 
This tutorial aims to equip the reader with the necessary knowledge and practical skills 
to develop and deploy custom VALAWAI components using Python and Pika.
