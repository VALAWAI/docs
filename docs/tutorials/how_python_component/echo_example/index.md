  - [Step 1. Set up the Project Structure](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_01): 
  explain the structure of the project.
  - [Step 2 (Optional). Set up the development environment](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_02): 
  explain the creation of a development environment.
  - Step 3. Defining the component service: explain how to define the component service.
  - Step 4. Implementing the component service: explain how to implement the component service.
  - Step 5. Testing the component: explain how to test the component.

All the code for this example is publicly accessible in
