# Echo Example

In this section, we will walk through the step-by-step creation of a C1 component named "echo." 
This component will receive messages and echo them back, the steps to crete it are:


In this section, we will guide you through the step-by-step creation of a basic VALAWAI
**C1** component named "echo." This component will demonstrate the fundamental principles
of receiving and echoing messages back. The following steps outline the creation process:

- **[Step 0: Prerequisites](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_00):** 
This section details the necessary software and setup required before you begin building the component.
- **[Step 1: Set up the Project Structure](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_01):** 
Here, we establish the recommended file and directory organization for the "echo" component.
- **[Step 2 (Optional): Isolated Development Environment with Docker](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_02):** 
This step explains how to create an isolated development environment using Docker 
for a consistent and conflict-free development experience.
- **[Step 3: Component Lifecycle](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_03):** 
We will implement the essential lifecycle methods that govern how your component starts, runs, 
and stops.
- **[Step 4: Component Services](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_04):** 
This section focuses on implementing the core functionality of the "echo" component â€“ the services 
it provides for message handling.
- **[Step 5: Component Deployment](/docs/tutorials/how_python_component/echo_example/step_05):** 
Finally, we will guide you through the process of containerizing your component using Docker 
and deploying it using Docker Compose.
